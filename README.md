## Installation
You can use fsockettu instead of the original web client to remotely administrate your transmission application.

#### Linux
Without overwriting the default Web Interface, you can drop the fsockettu files into: `/usr/local/share/transmission/web`.
make sure backup the default Web Interface by using this `sudo mv /usr/local/share/transmission/web /usr/local/share/transmission/web.bak`
and then clone it `sudo git clone git://github.com/najashark/fsockettu.git /usr/local/share/transmission/web`

## Configuration
fsockettu supports the easy selection of a predefined location to download your torrents to. Put locations into the  `config/location.js` configuration file. See `config/locations.js.example` for an example.

## Shortcuts
You can drag to select multiple torrents. kettu also has a few hotkeys:

 - `Cmd/Ctrl+A` - select all
 - `Cmd/Ctrl+Backspace` - delete the selected torrents
 - `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+Backspace` - delete finished torrents. A torrent is defined as finished if it has finished downloading and is paused.

## Revert
To revert back to the original Transmission web interface:

`sudo mv /usr/share/transmission/web.bak /usr/share/transmission/web`
